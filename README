The bitstream folder contains the .bit, .hwh and the .tcl files needed to run the FFT on hardware. The next steps is to take these files
and to generate a python script to try to produce an FFT on the FPGA. 

Currently, the CodeUpdate jupyter notebook file has the software implementation that should generate a dictionary of song fingerprints 
based on their FFTs. To run the code, go through the first four blocks on the the jupyter notebook and the code should already produce the dictionary.
Only 2 songs are in the GitHub repo, but next steps will be to fully create a dictionary of 5 songs with their FFT based fingerprints and to write a short script 
that takes this dictionary and a sample song to try to match the inputted song with a song on the dictionary.
