The bitstream folder contains the .bit, .hwh and the .tcl files needed to run the FFT and the comparison on the hardware. The directory path on the jupyter notebook would have to be edited so that the hardware would be able to find all of the bitstream files to run.
There are two .wav files in the folder. Changing the name of the inputted .wav file on the software code would allow for the software scripts to run. Each hardware block can run seperately, but at this point, I did not test the hardware being able to take in the .wav file and converting it into the 1024 buffer needed for the FFT overlay to generate an FFT spectrum.
